# Security Policy

We are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of our users. We value and appreciate your contributions in
identifying and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities in our project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible to help
us maintain a secure environment. We kindly ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices, giving us time to
address the issue before making any public disclosures.

To report a vulnerability, please email [gbianconi6@gmail.com](mailto:gbianconi6@gmail.com) with the following
information:

- **Detailed Description**: A clear and concise explanation of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed instructions or code to reproduce the issue.
- **Additional Information**: Any supporting material such as screenshots, logs, or proof of concept (PoC) code.

### Our Commitment:

- **Acknowledgement**: We will confirm receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
- **Resolution**: We will aim to address the issue as quickly as possible and keep you updated throughout the process.
- **Confidentiality**: We ask that you avoid public disclosure of the vulnerability until we have completed our
  investigation and implemented a fix.

For secure communication of sensitive information, please request our **PGP key**.

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of our project. Please ensure you are using the most up-to-date version to
benefit from security fixes:

| Version | Status             |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

We strongly recommend upgrading to supported versions to ensure you receive the latest security updates.

## Vulnerability Classification

We classify vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact, using the following categories:

- **Critical**: Issues that allow attackers to execute remote code, escalate privileges, or cause complete denial of
  service (DoS).
- **High**: Vulnerabilities that significantly compromise data security or privacy but are harder to exploit.
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that could result in moderate security or privacy risks under certain conditions.
- **Low**: Minor security issues with limited impact or low likelihood of exploitation.

We will prioritize addressing critical and high-severity vulnerabilities as swiftly as possible.

## Reporting a Security Incident

If you experience or suspect a security incident related to our project, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or
suspicious activities, please notify us immediately at [gbianconi6@gmail.com](mailto:gbianconi6@gmail.com).

### Incident Response Process:

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge the report and begin investigating within **48 hours** of receiving your
  notification.
- **Containment and Remediation**: We will work to contain and mitigate the impact of the incident.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Once the incident is resolved, we will conduct a root cause analysis to prevent future
  occurrences.

## Security Best Practices

We highly recommend adhering to the following security best practices when using our project:

- **Stay Updated**: Regularly update the software and apply the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Password Security**: Use strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Consider using a password manager to
  securely store them.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Wherever possible, enable 2FA to add an extra layer of protection.
- **Access Control**: Regularly audit user permissions and restrict access to sensitive data to only those who need it.
- **Be Cautious**: Avoid downloading files or clicking on links from unknown sources to reduce the risk of phishing or
  malware attacks.
- **Monitor Activity**: Regularly check for any suspicious or unauthorized activity, and report it immediately.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of our project, including the following components:

- **Core Applications**: All official applications and services developed by our team.
- **Infrastructure**: Servers, databases, and any other infrastructure supporting our project.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: While we strive to ensure security in third-party integrations, incidents involving
  third-party dependencies should be reported directly to their respective maintainers.

Note that incidents arising from unsupported versions of the project may not be eligible for a fix.

## Bug Bounty Program

To encourage responsible disclosure, we may offer **rewards** for high-impact vulnerability reports, based on severity
and potential risk. Details on our bug bounty program can be requested via [email](mailto:gbianconi6@gmail.com).

## Updates and Changes

We reserve the right to modify this security policy at any time to reflect updates in our project or changing security
practices. Any significant changes will be communicated via our website or through direct email notifications.
We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.

We sincerely appreciate your efforts in helping us secure our project and services. Thank you for your commitment to a
safer environment for all users.
